            Writing is the same: 1000 words are always 1000 words, whatever the topic is, whatever your today writing mood. This doesn’t mean that it is always easy, sometimes it is not and sometimes you look as mesmerized by the blank paper…no ideas, no motion, nothing at all. In this case, a stroll in a park or a coffee break with your friends can play down the impasse and give you new energies.</p>
